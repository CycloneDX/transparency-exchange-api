# CycloneDX BOM exchange API

## Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC2119](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### ABNF Syntax

ABNF syntax used as per
[RFC5234: Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications: ABNF](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5234).

ABNF rules are used from [RFC3986: Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax - Appendix A. Collected ABNF for URI](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986/#appendix-A).

These additional rules are defined:

```text
system-url       = supported-scheme ":" hier-part
                       ; a system defined URL
                       ; hier-part as defined in RFC3986
supported-scheme = "http" / "https"
```

See also: [RFC7231: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231)

## Specification Compliance

An API server/client can be referred to as compliant if it correctly implements
any of the methods described within this specification. It is not a
requirement to implement all the methods described.

## BOM Retrieval

This method is for retrieving a BOM from a system.

The BOM retrieval URL MUST comply with this syntax:

```text
bom-retrieval-url    = system-url "?" bom-identifier-query
bom-identifier-query = "bomIdentifier=" bom-identifier
bom-identifier       = *( pchar / "/" / "?" )
                        ; an identifier that uniquely identifies a BOM
                        ; pchar as defined in RFC3986
```

The HTTP request method MUST be `GET`.

For CycloneDX BOMs the `bom-identifier` MUST be either a CDX URN (https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-formal/cdx)
or a BOM serial number UUID URN (https://cyclonedx.org/docs/1.4/json/#serialNumber).

For SPDX documents the `bom-identifier` MUST be the SPDX Document Namespace
(https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/document-creation-information/#65-spdx-document-namespace-field).

### Server Requirements

Servers MAY require authorization. If authorization is required it MUST
use the HTTP `Authorization` header. If a server requires authorization, and
no `Authorization` request header is supplied by the client, the server
MUST respond with a 401 Unauthorized response.

Servers MUST honour the requested content types in the `Accept` header. If
the server does not support any of the requested content types a HTTP 406 response
MUST be returned. The 406 response body MUST contain a list of server supported
content types in the below format with `text/plain` content type.

```text
media-type *(", " media-type)
```

e.g. `application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.4, application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.3`

API servers MUST provide the correct `Content-Type` HTTP response header. For example:

```text
Content-Type: application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.4
```

If a BOM serial number UUID URN is used as the `bom-identifier`, the server
MUST respond with the latest available version of the BOM.

### Client Requirements

- Clients MUST support an optional `Authorization` header being specified.
- Clients MUST provide a `Accept` HTTP request header. For example:

```text
Accept: application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.4, application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.3
```

## BOM Submission Endpoint

This method is for submitting a BOM to a system.

The BOM submission URL MUST comply with this syntax:

```text
bom-submission-url = system-url
```

The HTTP request method MUST be `POST`.

### Server Requirements

Servers MAY require authorization. If authorization is required it MUST
use the HTTP `Authorization` header. If a server requires authorization, and
no `Authorization` request header is supplied by the client, the server
MUST respond with a 401 Unauthorized response.

Servers MUST honour the specified content type in the `Content-Type` header. If
the server does not support the supplied content type a HTTP 415 Unsupported
Media Type response MUST be returned. The 415 response body MUST contain a list
of server supported content types in the below format with `text/plain` content type.

```
media-type *(", " media-type)
```

e.g. `application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.4, application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.3`

If the submitted BOM has been successfully submitted the API server MUST
respond with an appropriate 2xx HTTP status code.

### Client Requirements

Clients MUST support an optional `Authorization` header being specified.

Clients MUST provide the correct `Content-Type` HTTP request header. For example:

```text
Content-Type: application/vnd.cyclonedx+xml; version=1.4
```
