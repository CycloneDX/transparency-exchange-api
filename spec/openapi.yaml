    # Query by identifier
    #
    # Since OpenAPI 3.0 it is possible to use RFC 6570-based serialization for JSON parameters of type array or object:
    #   https://swagger.io/docs/specification/v3_0/serialization/
    #
    # Unfortunately many tools don't support it, for example,
    # the `openapi-generator` for Java does not handle this correctly.
    #   https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/4808
    #
    # This can be uncommented, when RFC 6570-base serialization reaches a wider adoption:
    #
    # identifier-param:
    #   name: identifierParam
    #   description: If present, only the objects with the given identifier will be returned.
    #   in: query
    #   schema:
    #     $ref: "#/components/schemas/identifier"
    #   style: form
    #   explode: true
    #
    # In the meantime we explode the object manually:
    id-type:
      # To allow RFC 6570 in the future without breaking changes to the HTTP API,
      # the name of this parameter should be identical to the equivalent property in /components/schemas/identifier
