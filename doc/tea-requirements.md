# TEA Requirements

## Repository discovery
Based on an identifier a repository URL needs to be found. The identifier can be:

- PURL
- Product name or Product SKU and vendor name
- EAN bar code
- Product  SKU
- Vendor UUID
- Hash of object

At the base URL well known URLs (ref) needs to point to

- A lifecycle status document (using OWASP Common Life-cycle Enumeration, CLE)
- A version list. For each version, a URL will point to where a **collection** can be found
- Vendor Discovery, returns a list of Vendors represented in the repository
  - Vendor Name
  - Vendor ID

As an alternative, discovery using a company's ordinary web site should be supported.
This can be handled using the file security.txt (IETF RFC 9116)

## Artifact Discovery based on TEA collections

The API MUST provide a way to discover the artifacts that are available for retrieval or further query.
Discovery SHOULD group artifacts together that represent a **collection**
that are directly applicable to a given product with a given version.
Collections are OPTIONAL.

- SBOM - Software Bill of Material
- CBOM - Cryptography Bill of Material
- HBOM - Hardware Bill of Material
- VDR - Vulnerability Disclosure Report
- VEX - Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange
- CDXA - Attestation

Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Collection Management

The API SHOULD provide a method to manage collections, such as adding new collections,
modifying collections, or deleting existing collections.

- Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Artifact Retrieval

The API MUST provide a method in which to retrieve an artifact based on the identity of the artifact.
For example, using CycloneDX BOM-Link to retrieve either the
latest version or specific version of an artifact.

```text
urn:cdx:serialNumber
urn:cdx:serialNumber/version
```

The API needs to provide support for update checks, i.e. to check if a document is
updated without downloading. (possibly etag or HEAD method or similar)
Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Artifact Publishing

The API MUST provide a way to publish an artifact, either standalone or to a collection. 
The detection of duplicate artifacts with the same identity MUST be handled and prevented.
Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## Artifact Versioning

The system and API must support artifact versioning for formats that support
versioning such as CycloneDX. For example:

- The ability to retrieve the latest SBOM vs a previous (uncorrected) version of the same SBOM.
  Corrections to SBOMs is a supported use case in the NTIA framing document.
- The ability to retrieve the latest VEX along with previous VEX for the same product so
  that time-series decisions are transparently available.

Authn/Authz MUST be supported

## insights: Search Artifact Inventory

The API MUST provide a way to search the inventory of a specific BOM or all available BOMs
for a given component or service. The API SHOULD support multiple identity formats including
PURL, CPE, SWID, GAV, GTIN, and GMN.

For example:

- Return the identity of all BOMs that have a vulnerable version of Apache Log4J: 
  `pkg:maven/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core@2.10.0`

The API MUST provide a way to search for the metadata component across all available BOMs. 
The API SHOULD support multiple identity formats including PURL, CPE, SWID, GAV, GTIN, and GMN. 
For example:

- Return the identity of all artifacts that describe `cpe:/a:acme:commerce_suite:1.0`.

Authn/Authz MUST be supported
